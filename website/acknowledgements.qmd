This website would not be possible without the [quarto](https://quarto.org/) package. This course draws inspiration from several open educational resources on the internet, including 
two books and accompanying materials by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe: [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/) and
[Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)
