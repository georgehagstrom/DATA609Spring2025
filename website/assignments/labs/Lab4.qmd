## Problem 1: (Exercise 3.2 in CVX Book) 

(a) The figure below shows three levels sets for a function $f$. The value of the function on the level set is indicated by the number next to each curve. For example, the
curve labeled $1$ corresponds to the points $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^2$ satisfying $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$. Determine whether it is possible for the function $f$ to be convex,
concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. Give a brief justification for your answer.
Note: it may be that several options are possible, that one is possible, or that none at all are.

(b) The figure below shows level sets for a different function $g$. Again determine whether it is possible for the function $g$ to be convex, concave, quasiconvex, or quasiconcave. Note: it may be that several options are possible, that one is possible, or that none at all are.

## Problem 2: (CVX Book Extended Exercises 3.1)

Determine the curvature of the functions below. Your responses can be affine, convex, concave, or none (meaning not convex or concave). Provide a brief justification

(a) $f(x) = \min(2,x,\sqrt{x})$ with $\mathbf{dom} f = \{x\,|\, x\geq 0\}$ (i.e. $\mathbb{R}_+$)
(b) $f(x) = x^3$, with  $\mathbf{dom} f = \mathbb{R}$ 
(c) $f(x) = x^3$, with   $\mathbf{dom} f = \{x\,|\, x\geq 1\}$
(d) $f(x,y) = \sqrt{x\min(y,2)}$, with $\mathbf{dom} f = \{(x,y)\,|\, x\geq 0\, , y\geq 0\}$ (i.e. $\mathbb{R}^2_+$)
(e) $f(x,y) = \left(\sqrt{x} +\sqrt{y}\right)^2$ with $\mathbf{dom} f = \{(x,y)\,|\, x\geq 0\,,\, y\geq 0\}$ (i.e. $\mathbb{R}^2_+$)


## Problem 3: (Selected from CVX Book Extended Exercises 3.51-3.52)

For each of the following problems implement the following functions using Disciplined Convex Programming and CVX, 
and use CVX to verify that they are convex

(a) $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{xy}$, with $\mathbf{dom} f = \mathbb{R}^2_{++}$. Hint: Use the Atoms listed below part (b) as well as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. 
There are multiple ways to solve this problem.

(b) $f(x,y) = \sqrt{1+\frac{x^2}{y}}$, with $\mathbf{dom} f = \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{++}$ (this means $x$ is any real number and $y$ is strictly greater than 0. 

Hint: The following atoms may be helpful, there are multiple ways to solve this problem.

- `inv_pos(u)`, which is $1/u$, with domain $\mathbb{R}_{++}$
- `square(u)`, which is `u^2` , with domain $\mathbb{R}$
- `sqrt(u)`, which is $\sqrt{u}$, with domain $\mathbb{R}_+$
- `geo_mean(u,v)`, which is $\sqrt{uv}$, with domain $\mathbb{R}^2_+$
- `quad_over_lin(u,v)`, which is $u^2/v$, with domain $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}_{++}$
- `norm2(u,v)`, which is $\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$ , with domain $\mathbb{R}^2$.



## Problem 4: Periodic Poisson Regression to predict Car Crashes

For this problem, we will be working with the dataset [nyc_crashes.csv](https://github.com/georgehagstrom/DATA609Spring2025/blob/main/website/assignments/labs/labData/nyc_crashes.csv), which contains a time series of the number of car crashes occurring in Manhattan every hour
for a period of time. Here we will develop a Poisson regression model to predict rate of crashes during each time of day. 


(a) Consider the following statistical model for the number of crashes $N_i$ during hour $i$ of a given day.

$$
N_i \sim \exp(-\lambda_i)\frac{\lambda_i^{N_i}}{{N_i}!}
$$

where $i$ ranges from $0$ to $23$ and corresponds to the hour of the day. Suppose that we have a dataset of counts for crashes where $C_{ni}$ is the number of
crashes that occur in the $i$th hour of the $n$th day. Then the `log` likelihood function for the parameters $\lambda$ is:
$$
- \log(p(C|\lambda)) = \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{i=0}^{23} \left( \lambda_i - C_{ni}\log(\lambda_i) + \log(C_{ni}!)\right) 
$$

However, we can drop terms terms that don't depend on $\lambda$ because they will have no impact on the maximum likelihood solution. This lets us form a simpler objective function:

$$
L(C|\lambda) = \sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{i=0}^{23} \left(\lambda_i - C_{ni}\log(\lambda_i)\right)
$$
or if we use matrix-vector notation:
$$
L(C|\lambda) = N\mathbf{1}^T\lambda - \mathbf{1}^T C \log(\lambda)
$$
where $\log(\lambda)$ is interpreted as a vector whose $i$th entry is $\log(\lambda_i)$ and the vector $\mathbf{1}^T$ has all entries equal to $1$ and has the right dimension in each case to make the resulting expressions scalars (24 and $N$, for our dataset $N$ will be 43).

Show that $L(C|\lambda)$ is a convex function of the coefficients $\lambda$ on the domain $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{24}_{++}$. 

(b) The log-likelihood function $L$ can be minimized to find the maximum likelihood estimate for the $\lambda$ coefficients. Formulate this constrained optimization problem in `CVX`
and solve it for the NYC crashes dataset, that is solve:

$$
\min_{\lambda} L(C|\lambda) \\
\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{24}_{+}
$$

 Make a plot of the $\lambda$ coefficients

(c) It would be reasonable to expect that the rate of crashes in two adjacent hours should be similar, i.e. the observation that there has been a crash at 3:01PM should influence the 
estimate of the rate of crashes between 2:00PM and 3:00PM in addition to between 3:00PM and 4:00PM. One way to implement this is through the following regularization term, which applies
a penalty proportional to the square of the difference between $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_{i+1}$:
$$
L_{pen}(C|\lambda,\rho) = L(C|\lambda) + \rho\left( \sum_{i=1}^{23} (\lambda_i-\lambda_{i-1})^2 + (\lambda_0-\lambda_{23})^2\right)
$$

Assuming that $\rho>0$, show that $L_{pen}(C|\lambda)$ is a convex function on $\mathbb{R}^{24}_{++}$ 

(d) Formulate the regularized maximum likelihood problem:


$$
\min_{\lambda} L_{pen}(C|\lambda,\rho) \\
\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{24}_{+} \\
$$

and solve it using `CVX`. Solve it for a range of positive values $\rho$ such that for your smallest values the solution appears like your solution to (b) and for your largest values
the $\lambda$ show much less variation over time.

Hint: There are many ways to implement this penalty term in `cvx`. A way that you might find useful is to define a matrix $S$ where $S_{ii} = 1$, $S_{i,i-1} = -1$ for $i>1$ and $S_{1,24}=-1$, with $S=0$ for all other entries:


Then $S\lambda = \begin{bmatrix} [(\lambda_1 - \lambda_{24}) & (\lambda_2-\lambda_1) & \cdots & (\lambda_{24}-\lambda_{23}) \end{bmatrix}^T$, and you can
use `cvx.square` and `cvx.sum` to construct the objective.
