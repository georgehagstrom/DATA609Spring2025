## Instructions

Please submit a .qmd file along with a rendered pdf to the Brightspace page for this assignment. You may use whatever language you like within your qmd file,
I recommend python, julia, or R. 

## Problem 1: Online Updating for Least Squares

Many applications of least squares (and other statistical methods)
involve \emph{streaming data}, in which data is collected over a time
period and the statistical model is updated as new data arrives. If
the quantity of data arriving is very large, it may not be possible to
refit the entire model on the entire dataset. Instead, we use
techniques (often referred to as \emph{online learning} which take the current model as a starting point and 
update them to incorporate the new data. Solve exercise 12.14 from VMLS

## Problem 2: Weighted Least Squares

The file [social-mobility.csv]() contains data on the fraction of 
individuals born in the years 1980-1982 to parents in the bottom 20\% of the income distribution who reach the top 20\% of the income distribution by the time they turn 30 in a large number of municipalities throughout the United States. The dataset also contains 
additional variables that describe other socio-economic differences 
between the cities in the dataset.

(a) Make a scatter-plot of mobility versus population (use a log-scale for population). What do you 
notice about the variance of social mobility as a function of population? This is a common feature of nearly every dataset containing geographic regions with widely different populations.

(b) Assume that the number of children born in families making below the 20th percentile of the income distribution in each city is linearly proportional to the city population. Write down a formula 
for how the variance of each measurement of the social mobility based
on the measured social mobility and the population. Hint: start with
either the formula for the variance of binomial counts or look up the
variance of a proportion derived from a binomial distribution. Don't
worry about constant factors when deriving this formula.

(c) Use weighted least squares to calculate an estimate of how 
social mobility depends on commute time and student-teacher ratio, using weights calculated based on the variance estimate derived in (b).
Compare the coefficients to those derived from ordinary least squares with no weights.

##Problem 3: Markowitz Portfolio Optimization

In this problem you will use _Markowitz Portfolio Optimization_ to construct a set of portfolios that aim to achieve certain target rates of return while minimizing risk. The file [prices.csv]() contains information on daily asset returns from 2020-2024 for a group of assets. The data is divided into two time periods, a training period (2020-2022) and a testing period (2022-2024).

(a)  Construct a vector of annual returns $\mu$ and return covariance
$\Gamma$. Then solve the following constrained least squares problem
to calculate optimal portfolios achieving a fixed rate of return
with minimum variance:
$$
    \min_{w} x^T\Gamma x,\\
    w^T\mu = r
$$

Calculate optimal portfolios based on the 2020-2022 data for targeted
rates of return $r=5\%$, $r=10\%$, and $r=20\%$.

(b) Plot the cumulative value of each portfolio over time,
starting from an initial investment of $\$10000$, for both the 
training and test sets of returns.

For each of the 3 portfolios report:

- The annualized return on the training and test sets;
- The annualized risk on the training and test sets;
- The asset with the minimum allocation weight (can be the most negative), and its weight;
- The asset with the maximum allocation weight, and its weight;
- The leverage, defined as |w1| + · · · + |wn|. (Several other definitions of leverage are used.) This
number is always at least one, and it is exactly one only if the portfolio has no short positions.

Comment briefly on your observations about the different portfolios and the difference between their training and testing performance.

(c) It is well known that optimal portfolios constructed using the
Markowitz procedure perform much more poorly out of sample compared to in sample. This is due to a variety of reasons, one of which is that it assumes that future returns are equal to past returns, another that
the correlation structure of the market might change over time, and
finally, when there are many assets there is the potential for overfitting. Repeat the previous problem but introduce a ridge regression/$l_2$ norm penalty term to the objective function, with
a hyperparameter $\lamba$ governing the size of the penalty term. 

Select 10 positive values of $\lamba$ on a log scale between $1e-1$ and $10$ and for each value of $\lamba$ solve the following penalized
regression problem:

$$
    \min_{w} w^T(\Gamma+\lambda I) w ,\\
    w^T\mu = r
$$

for just the single value of $r=20\%$. Then calculate the performance
of each of these regularized Markowitz strategies on both the training and test datasets
and plot the values of:

- The annualized return on the training and test sets;
- The annualized risk on the training and test sets;
- The minimum allocation weight;
- The maximum allocation weight;
- The leverage

Comment on how the different values of $\lambda$ changed the optimal
portfolios and the difference between in-sample and out-of-sample return and variance.
