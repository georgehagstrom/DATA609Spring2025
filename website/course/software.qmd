This class will involve a number of computational homework assignments. These can be completed in a variety of different programming languages. I recommend that you use python or Julia
to complete the assignments, but it is also possible to use R. 

Guide to Base Languages:

1. Python

[scipy.linalg](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html) is a useful package for linear algebra in python

[CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/dcp/) is the implementation of the CVX package in python

[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a package for neural networks in python

2. Julia

[CONVEX.jl](https://jump.dev/Convex.jl/stable/) is the implementation of the CVX package in Julia

[torch.jl](https://docs.juliahub.com/Torch/2cR1S/0.1.3/) provides torch functionality for deep learning in julia.

[flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/) is another good option for deep learning.

3. R

[CVXR](https://cvxr.rbind.io/) is the implementation of the CVX package in R.

[torch for R](https://torch.mlverse.org/) Can be used to implement neural networks in R
