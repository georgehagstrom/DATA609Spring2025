**George Hagstrom, Ph.D.**  
**Email:** [george.hagstrom@cuny.edu](mailto:george.hagstrom@cuny.edu)  

I am currently a Doctoral Lecturer in [Data Science and Information Systems](https://sps.cuny.edu/academics/graduate/master-science-data-science-ms) at the [City University of New York](https://sps.cuny.edu). Additionally, I am a consultant with Princeton University where I development mathematical models of marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria to improve our
understanding of the Earth's Biogeochemical Cycles. Prior to joining CUNY, I was a Research Scientist at Princeton University in the Levin lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 
and a postdoctoral researcher in the Magneto Fluids Division at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. My [research interests](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2La77skAAAAJ&hl=en) include the application of Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning to incorporate nontraditional datasets (such as from 'omics) into mechanistic models of marine ecosystems and
biogeochemical cycling, trait-based modeling, and critical transitions in complex ecological, social, or economic systems. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and exploring New York City.

### Contact

Office Hours (Zoom is preferred): By appointment. You're encouraged to schedule an appointment and I have time nearly everyday. You are also encouraged to ask us questions on Slack. If you wish to ask a question in private, you can email me directly.

For the most part, you can expect me to respond to questions by email within 24 hours. If you do not hear back from me within 48 hours of sending an email, please resend your message. I will be checking in on the course regularly, just about every day and likely several times each day. Please do not hesitate to ask if you have questions or concerns.
