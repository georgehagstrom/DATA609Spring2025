    "text": "George Hagstrom, Ph.D.\nEmail: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\nI am currently a Doctoral Lecturer in Data Science and Information Systems at the City University of New York. Additionally, I am a consultant with Princeton University where I development mathematical models of marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria to improve our understanding of the Earth’s Biogeochemical Cycles. Prior to joining CUNY, I was a Research Scientist at Princeton University in the Levin lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a postdoctoral researcher in the Magneto Fluids Division at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. My research interests include the application of Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning to incorporate nontraditional datasets (such as from ’omics) into mechanistic models of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling, trait-based modeling, and critical transitions in complex ecological, social, or economic systems. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and exploring New York City.\n\nContact\nOffice Hours (Zoom is preferred): By appointment. You’re encouraged to schedule an appointment and I have time nearly everyday. You are also encouraged to ask us questions on Slack. If you wish to ask a question in private, you can email me directly.\nFor the most part, you can expect me to respond to questions by email within 24 hours. If you do not hear back from me within 48 hours of sending an email, please resend your message. I will be checking in on the course regularly, just about every day and likely several times each day. Please do not hesitate to ask if you have questions or concerns.",

    "text": "Required\nThis course makes use of several textbooks. I have attempted when possible to choose resources which are freely available.\n\nStephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\n\nThis book provides a strong practical introduction to Linear Algebra. We are primarily using the later parts of the book to learn about applications of least squares. However, you are encouraged to use earlier parts of the book to review linear algebra if needed.\n\nLieven Vandenberghe and Stephen Boyd. Convex Optimization\n\nThis is an excellent book on practical applications of convex optimization. We will use the first half of the book, which focuses on identifying convex optimization problems.\n\nIan Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning\n\nThis is a good introduction to neural networks and deep learning.\n\n\nOptional\n\nYang Xin-She. Introduction to algorithms for data mining and machine learning. Academic press, 2019.\n\nThis textbook provides a concise introduction to optimization for machine learning.\n\nDavid Mackay Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\n\nThis is free textbook covers a large number of topics that are of relevance to data science, often from a slightly different perspective than standard treatments. It provides an excellent introduction to Bayesian Inference and Neural Networks, but applies ideas from information theory too.",

    "text": "This week we will talk about the most basic and most important class of optimization problems, least squares optimization. Whenever you fit a linear regression, you are solving a least squares problems, and least squares methods have applications across all quantitative fields. Although least squares methods are simple, they should not be dismissed- the fact that we can solve them rapidly, reliably means that it is useful to know how to formulate them in applied situations and how to solve them.\nIn this week we will go over the basics and a few simple applications, while the two weeks after this will explore data fitting examples and how to handle more complicated cases.\nYour first homework assignment will be due next Sunday.\nHere are more details on what you need to do this week:\n\nGo through module 2 and complete the week 2 readings.\nAttend our second meetup on Monday at 6:45 p.m. ET on Zoom\nContinue working on Lab 1"

I also solve a problem where I re-express the formula for the pseudoinverse of a matrix using the singular value decomposition of that matrix. I did it sort of to show how you might write out a long math expression in markdown, and to talk about matrix algebra and the properties of the SVD. This calculation is quite a bit more invovled than what I am asking on the homework, so don’t be intimidated.\nClick here to watch the video on youtube\nYou may also find the numpy documentation helpful: Click Here\nI have also included the ipython notebook"

    "text": "Problem 1: Gradient Descent\n\nConsider the mathematical function defined on \\(f: \\mathbb{R}^2\\,\\to\\, \\mathbb{R}\\):\n\n\\[\nf(x,y) = (x-1)^2 + (y+2)^2,\n\\]\nFind the single critical point of this function and show that it is a local minimum (in this case, this will also be a global minimum).\n\nNow consider a new objective function that depends on a parameter \\(b\\): \\[\nf(x,y) = x^2 + by^2\n\\] Here we will look at two different values of \\(b\\), \\(b=3\\) and \\(b=10\\). The global minimum of this function occurs at the point \\(x^* = 0\\), \\(y^*=0\\) no matter what the value of \\(b\\). Suppose that we didn’t know this and wanted to find the minimum of this function using gradient descent instead of direct calculation.\n\n\nFirst write code to perform the gradient descent algorithm, that is perform the iteration: \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{v}_n - k \\nabla f(\\mathbf{v}_n),\n\\]\n\nwhere the vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} x & y\\end{bmatrix}^T\\) and \\(k\\) is the learning rate.\n\nThen test the performance of your algorithm as a function of the learning rates \\(k\\) by performing 100 iterations of the algorithm for 100 values of \\(k\\) equally spaced between \\(k=0.01\\) and \\(k=0.3\\). Start with an initial guess of \\(\\mathbf{v}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} b & 1\\end{bmatrix}^T\\). Do this for \\(b=3\\) and \\(b=10\\). Make separate plots for \\(b=3\\) and \\(b=10\\) of the log base 10 of the error (in this case it is \\(\\sqrt{x_{100}^2+y_{100}^2}\\)) for the final value of the iteration versus the value of \\(k\\). How does learning rate relate to the final value of the error? For which value of \\(b\\) does the algorithm have the ability to converge fastest (have the lowest value of the error at the end)?\n\nNote: For some combinations of \\(k\\) and \\(b\\), the algorithm won’t converge to the right answer, i.e. the error will grow with time. To make your plot easier to read, don’t plot the error for iterations that didn’t converge.\n\nAs \\(k\\) increases, for one or both values of \\(b\\), you will observe a point where the trend of final error versus learning rate reverses direction. Pick a value of \\(k\\) very close to the point where this occurs, and make a contour plot of the function \\(f\\) and the trajectory of the iterations for the gradient descent algorithm for that value of \\(k\\) superimposed over the contour plot. What do you observe?\n\nNote: The differences that you observe here are a special case of a more general phenomenon: the speed of convergence of gradient descent depends on something called the condition number of the Hessian matrix (the matrix of the 2nd order partial derivatives) of the target function. The condition number for a symmetric matrix is just the ratio of the largest to smallest eigenvalues, in this case the condition number is \\(b\\) (or 1/\\(b\\)). Gradient descent performs worse and worse the larger the condition number (and large condition numbers are problematic for a wide variety of other numerical methods)."

    "text": "Problem 3: Iterative Solutions to Least Squares\nAlthough the pseudoinverse provides an exact formula for the least squares solutions, there are some situations in which using the exact solution is computationally difficult, particularly when the matrix \\(A\\) and vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) have a large number of entries. In isn’t out of the ordinary for \\(A^TA\\) to be more than a terabyte, for example . In these cases it may be better to use an approximate solution instead of the exact formula. There are many different approximate methods for solving least squares problems, here we will use an iterative method developed by Richardson.\nThis method begins with an initial guess \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)} = 0\\) and calculates successive approximations as follows:\n\\[\n    \\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(k)} - \\mu A^T\\left(A\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}-\\mathbf{b}\\right)\n\\]\nHere \\(\\mu\\) is a positive paramter that has a similar interpretation to the learning rate for gradient descent. A choice that guarantees convergence is \\(\\mu \\leq \\frac{1}{\\|A\\|}\\). The iteration is terminated when the change in the residual \\(\\|A^T(Ax^{(k)} − b)\\|\\) after successive steps is below a user determined threshold, which indicates that the least squares optimality conditions are nearly satisfied.\n\nSuppose that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a solution to the least squares problem: \\[\n\\mathbf{x} = A^+\\mathbf{b}\n\\]\n\nShow by substitution of the formula for the pseudoinverse that \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a fixed-point of the iteration scheme, i.e. that: \\[\n\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mu A^T\\left(A\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{b}\\right)\n\\]\n\nGenerate a random 20 × 10 matrix \\(A\\) and 20-vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and compute the least squares solution \\(\\mathbf{x} = A^+\\mathbf{b}\\). Then run the Richardson algorithm with \\(\\mu = \\frac{1}{\\|A\\|^2}\\) for 500 iterations, and plot \\(\\|\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}-\\mathbf{x}\\|\\) to verify that \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}\\) is converging to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)"

    "text": "Problem 1: Online Updating for Least Squares and Autoregressive Time Series Models\nMany applications of least squares (and other statistical methods) involve , in which data is collected over a time period and the statistical model is updated as new data arrives. If the quantity of data arriving is very large, it may be inefficient or even impossible to refit the entire model on the entire dataset. Instead, we use techniques (often referred to as which take the current model as a starting point and update them to incorporate the new data.\nThe structure of least squares problems makes them amenable to online updating (sometimes this is called “recursive” least squares). The structure of the problem is as follows, at time \\(t\\) we receive a vector of observations \\(\\mathbf{a}_t\\) and an observation of our target variable \\(b_t\\).\nThe full set of all observations that we have received up to time \\(t\\) is contained in the following matrix:\n\\[\nA_{(t)} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_1^T \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_2^T \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_t^T \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwhich says that row \\(j\\) of the matrix \\(A_{(t)}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation \\(\\mathbf{a}_j^T\\).\nThe observations up to the time \\(t\\) of the target variable are similarly encoded in a vector: \\[\n\\mathbf{b}_{(t)} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_t \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nHere we assume that the vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) each contain \\(n\\) observations, so that \\(A_{(t)}\\) is a \\(t\\times n\\) matrix and the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}_{(t)}\\) is a \\(t\\)-vector.\nAs long as \\(t&gt;n\\), i.e. the number of time observations is greater than the number of features/data points in each observation, we can fit a linear model predicting the target as a function of the features \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) by solving the least squares problem:\n\\[\n(A^T_{(t)}A_{(t)})\\mathbf{x} = A_{(t)}^T\\mathbf{b}_{(t)}\n\\]\nAs the length of the time series increases, the computational difficulty of solving the problem also increases. However, a remarkable result in linear algebra called the matrix inversion lemma allows us to efficiently update the solution of the least squares problem."

    "text": "Problem 2: Weighted Least Squares\nThe file social-mobility.csv contains data on the fraction of individuals born in the years 1980-1982 to parents in the bottom 20% of the income distribution who reach the top 20% of the income distribution by the time they turn 30 in a large number of municipalities throughout the United States. The dataset also contains additional variables that describe other socio-economic differences between the cities in the dataset.\n\nMake a scatter-plot of mobility versus population (use a log-scale for population). What do you notice about the variance of social mobility as a function of population? This is a common feature of nearly every dataset containing geographic regions with widely different populations.\nAssume that the number of children born in families making below the 20th percentile of the income distribution in each city is linearly proportional to the city population. Write down a formula for how the variance of each measurement of the social mobility based on the measured social mobility and the population. Hint: start with either the formula for the variance of binomial counts or look up the variance of a proportion derived from a binomial distribution. Don’t worry about constant factors when deriving this formula.\nUse weighted least squares to calculate an estimate of how social mobility depends on commute time and student-teacher ratio, using weights calculated based on the variance estimate derived in (b). Compare the coefficients to those derived from ordinary least squares with no weights.\n\n##Problem 3: Markowitz Portfolio Optimization\nIn this problem you will use Markowitz Portfolio Optimization to construct a set of portfolios that aim to achieve certain target rates of return while minimizing risk. The file prices.csv contains information on daily asset returns from 2020-2024 for a group of assets. The data is divided into two time periods, a training period (2020-2022) and a testing period (2022-2024).\n\nConstruct a vector of annual returns \\(\\mu\\) and return covariance \\(\\Gamma\\). Then solve the following constrained least squares problem to calculate optimal portfolios achieving a fixed rate of return with minimum variance: \\[\n    \\min_{w} x^T\\Gamma x,\\\\\n    w^T\\mu = r\n\\]\n\nCalculate optimal portfolios based on the 2020-2022 data for targeted rates of return \\(r=5\\%\\), \\(r=10\\%\\), and \\(r=20\\%\\).\n\nPlot the cumulative value of each portfolio over time, starting from an initial investment of \\(\\$10000\\), for both the training and test sets of returns.\n\nFor each of the 3 portfolios report:\n\nThe annualized return on the training and test sets;\nThe annualized risk on the training and test sets;\nThe asset with the minimum allocation weight (can be the most negative), and its weight;\nThe asset with the maximum allocation weight, and its weight;\nThe leverage, defined as |w1| + · · · + |wn|. (Several other definitions of leverage are used.) This number is always at least one, and it is exactly one only if the portfolio has no short positions.\n\nComment briefly on your observations about the different portfolios and the difference between their training and testing performance.\n\nIt is well known that optimal portfolios constructed using the Markowitz procedure perform much more poorly out of sample compared to in sample. This is due to a variety of reasons, one of which is that it assumes that future returns are equal to past returns, another that the correlation structure of the market might change over time, and finally, when there are many assets there is the potential for overfitting. Repeat the previous problem but introduce a ridge regression/\\(l_2\\) norm penalty term to the objective function, with a hyperparameter \\(\\lamba\\) governing the size of the penalty term.\n\nSelect 10 positive values of \\(\\lamba\\) on a log scale between \\(1e-1\\) and \\(10\\) and for each value of \\(\\lamba\\) solve the following penalized regression problem:\n\\[\n    \\min_{w} w^T(\\Gamma+\\lambda I) w ,\\\\\n    w^T\\mu = r\n\\]\nfor just the single value of \\(r=20\\%\\). Then calculate the performance of each of these regularized Markowitz strategies on both the training and test datasets and plot the values of:\n\nThe annualized return on the training and test sets;\nThe annualized risk on the training and test sets;\nThe minimum allocation weight;\nThe maximum allocation weight;\nThe leverage\n\nComment on how the different values of \\(\\lambda\\) changed the optimal portfolios and the difference between in-sample and out-of-sample return and variance."

form:     &lt;function diagonal at 0x7b3729c832e0&gt;\nFile:            ~/miniforge3/envs/stan/lib/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py\nDocstring:      \nReturn specified diagonals.\nIf `a` is 2-D, returns the diagonal of `a` with the given offset,\ni.e., the collection of elements of the form ``a[i, i+offset]``.  If\n`a` has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by `axis1`\nand `axis2` are used to determine the 2-D sub-array whose diagonal is\nreturned.  The shape of the resulting array can be determined by\nremoving `axis1` and `axis2` and appending an index to the right equal\nto the size of the resulting diagonals.\nIn versions of NumPy prior to 1.7, this function always returned a new,\nindependent array containing a copy of the values in the diagonal.\nIn NumPy 1.7 and 1.8, it continues to return a copy of the diagonal,\nbut depending on this fact is deprecated. Writing to the resulting\narray continues to work as it used to, but a FutureWarning is issued.\nStarting in NumPy 1.9 it returns a read-only view on the original array.\nAttempting to write to the resulting array will produce an error.\nIn some future release, it will return a read/write view and writing to\nthe returned array will alter your original array.  The returned array\nwill have the same type as the input array.\nIf you don't write to the array returned by this function, then you can\njust ignore all of the above.\nIf you depend on the current behavior, then we suggest copying the\nreturned array explicitly, i.e., use ``np.diagonal(a).copy()`` instead\nof just ``np.diagonal(a)``. This will work with both past and future\nversions of NumPy.\nParameters\n----------\na : array_like\n    Array from which the diagonals are taken.\noffset : int, optional\n    Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal.  Can be positive or\n    negative.  Defaults to main diagonal (0).\naxis1 : int, optional\n    Axis to be used as the first axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from which\n    the diagonals should be taken.  Defaults to first axis (0).\naxis2 : int, optional\n    Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from\n    which the diagonals should be taken.

    "text": "When working as a data scientist, and in particular, communicating your results and work in a technical document, you will need to be able to write mathematical expressions. One powerful tool for doing this is called LaTeX. LaTex is a its own programming language designed for rendering technical publications. It is commonly used in math and scientific fields, but a small subset of the language has been adopted in other environments including Microsoft Word and markdown, allowing you to render math using LaTeX commands. Knowing how to do this will be helpful for your homeworks, so I’ve decided to make a short video showing you the very basics of how this works.\nClick here to watch the video on youtube\nThere are a number of documents on the internet which explain the finer details of latex, and most of the lecture slides I shared use it, so you can see examples of how it works. I have also included the ipython notebook"

    "text": "Instructor: George Hagstrom, Ph.D. Class Meetup: Monday 7:00-8:00 Eastern Office Hours: By appointment Email: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\n\nDescription\nOptimization underlies nearly everything in statistics and machine learning, and has a wealth of applications across many different applied fields. Learning how to recognize and solve optimization problems will allow you to select the best algorithms to solve a given data science problem, give you a deeper understanding of statistics and machine learning tools, and enable you to find reformulations or approximations of problems that are substantially easier or more useful to solve.\nIn this course you will learn optimization theory through its practical applications to statistics and machine learning. The first half of the course will cover convex optimization (including least squares and linear programming as special cases), and the second half will cover methods for non-convex problems, primarily stochastic gradient descent and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Methods. Applications will include large-scale linear and logistic regression, regularization, maximum likelihood methods, support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian statistics, and optimization problems arising in an operations research or other business context.\n\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nUnderstand how to formulate major statistical and machine learning algorithms as optimization problems\nLearn how to recognize and solve least squares, linear programming, and convex optimization problems.\nLearn how to represent convex optimization problems in the CVX package\nUnderstand the basics of algorithmic complexity theory and use it to understand how quickly different algorithms will converge to the solution of an optimization problem\nImplement stochastic gradient descent for neural networks and other non-convex problems, understand trade-offs in algorithm design\n\n\n\nProgram Learning Outcomes\n\nBusiness Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build out data analytics solutions from understanding of business goals.\nSolid foundational data programming skills, using industry standard tools, essential algorithms, and design patterns for working with structured data, unstructured data and big data.\nSolid foundational math and statistics skills, with emphasis on linear algebra, probability, Bayesian statistics, and numerical methods.\nData understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.\nData preparation. Selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data.\nOptimization Modeling. Selecting optimization modeling techniques, generating test designs, building and assessing models.\nModel implementation and deployment.\nCommunicating results.\n\n\n\nGrading\n\nLabs (80%)\nProject (20%)\n\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Performance\nLetter Grade\nRange %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nExcellent - work is of exceptional quality\nA\n93 - 100\n4\n\n\nExcellent\nA-\n90 - 92.9\n3.7\n\n\nGood - work is above average\nB+\n87 - 89.9\n3.3\n\n\nSatisfactory\nB\n83 - 86.9\n3\n\n\nBelow Average\nB-\n80 - 82.9\n2.7\n\n\nPoor\nC+\n77 - 79.9\n2.3\n\n\nPoor\nC\n70 - 76.9\n2\n\n\nFailure\nF\n&lt; 70\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. A homework assignment will be due every other week, see the schedule for details). There will also be a final project required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nYou are expected to attend or watch every Meetup. I highly recommend attending the Meetups live if possible but understand that may not be possible for everyone. Recordings will be made available by the next morning on the Schedule page. In addition to highlighting key concepts from each learning module, some topics will be discussed that are not in the textbook. Moreover, we regularly make announcements in the Meetups that will be important to being successful in this course.\n\n\nTextbooks and Course Materials\nThis course makes use of several textbooks. I have attempted when possible to choose resources which are freely available.\n\nStephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares\nLieven Vandenberghe and Stephen Boyd. Convex Optimization\nIan Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning\n\n\nOptional\n\nYang Xin-She. Introduction to algorithms for data mining and machine learning. Academic press, 2019.\nDavid Mackay Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility and Accommodations\nThe CUNY School of Professional Studies is firmly committed to making higher education accessible to students with disabilities by removing architectural barriers and providing programs and support services necessary for them to benefit from the instruction and resources of the University. Early planning is essential for many of the resources and accommodations provided. Please see: http://sps.cuny.edu/student_services/disabilityservices.html\n\n\nOnline Etiquette and Anti-Harassment Policy\nThe University strictly prohibits the use of University online resources or facilities, including Brightspace, for the purpose of harassment of any individual or for the posting of any material that is scandalous, libelous, offensive or otherwise against the University’s policies. Please see: http://media.sps.cuny.edu/filestore/8/4/9_d018dae29d76f89/849_3c7d075b32c268e.pdf\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAcademic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Cheating, forgery, plagiarism and collusion in dishonest acts undermine the educational mission of the City University of New York and the students’ personal and intellectual growth. Please see: http://media.sps.cuny.edu/filestore/8/3/9_dea303d5822ab91/839_1753cee9c9d90e9.pdf\n\n\nStudent Support Services\nIf you need any additional help, please visit Student Support Services: http://sps.cuny.edu/student_resources/",
